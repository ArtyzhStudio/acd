        <p>
            The Anti&nbspClone&nbspDefender extension is designed to protect the user from getting on a phishing clone
            site. The
            mechanism
            of the extension is based on comparing links with the browser history, as well as with white and black lists
            of sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the link that the user wants to follow is determined to be dangerous, the page loading stops and a dialog
            box
            appears
            in which confirmation is required from the user about his intention to follow the link. Depending on the
            user's
            response, the link is added to the blacklist or whitelist. The presence of a link in the whitelist indicates
            that it is
            safe for the user, and it is no longer checked. The presence of a link in the blacklist confirms its danger.
            Lists can
            also be changed manually in the List management window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anti&nbspClone&nbspDefender considers a site suspicious if its domain name differs slightly from the domain
            name of
            the
            original
            site, so that the difference is not noticeable at a quick glance. Several letters may be swapped in this
            name,
            or one or
            two letters may be missing, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension protects the user from the deplorable consequences of inattention when going to a clone site,
            which can
            master user authentication data and other private data. The extension acts on the user's side and does not
            depend on how
            much the owner of the original site has protected his resource from clone sites.
        </p>


        <h1 id="2">Installation Guide</h1>
        <p>
            For the extension to work, a Chromium browser (Google Chrome) must be installed on the computer.,
            Chromium, Microsoft Edge, Yandex.Browser, Opera). There are three ways to install the extension in the
            browser: from
            store browser extensions, from the source code files folder and from the GitHub platform. From the store
            extensions the product is placed in a standard way, just like any other extension. Here's how the extension
            is put
            from the source code folder in different browsers:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yandex.Browser: To install an extension from a folder, you need to open the extensions page (<span><img
                        src="./screens/yandex.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Three dashes"></span> → Add-ons).
                Next, just open the standard file manager and drag the unzipped folder with the extension into the
                browser window. The extension will connect and start working.
            </li>
            <li>
                Google Chrome/Chromium: having a folder with the code, you can install the extension by going to the
                extensions page
                (<span><img src="./screens/chrome.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Три точки"></span> → More tools →
                Extensions). Next, you need to activate the "Developer Mode" in the upper right corner. The "Load
                unpacked" button appears in the upper left corner of the page. By clicking it, you need to select the
                extension folder and click "Open". The extension has entered into operation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opera: You need to go to the extensions page (<span><img src="./screens/opera.png" width="20"
                        height="20" alt="Logo"></span> → Extensions → Extensions). After activating the "Developer
                Mode" in
                the upper right corner, you need to click the "Load unpacked" button and select the
                unzipped folder
                with the extension using the system file manager.
            </li><span><img src="./screens/edge.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Три точки"></span>
            <li>
                Microsoft Edge: To install an extension from a folder, you need to go to extensions (<span><img
                        src="./screens/edge.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Three dots"></span> → Extensions → Manage
                extensions). Now you need to click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the extension.
                After confirming the selection, the extension will start working.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After installation, a window with buttons for configuring the extension appears in the browser extensions
            window. Using
            the "Details" button, you can view data such as the product version, the amount of memory used, and the
            installation
            source. Permission to access sites for the correct operation of the extension is not recommended to change,
            by default –
            "on all sites". The "Remove" button allows you to delete an extension if there is no need for its operation.
            And
            finally, the rightmost button allows you to turn the product on or off. When enabled, the extension runs in
            the
            background and monitors every update of browser tabs.

        <h1 id="3">User's Guide</h1>
        <p>
            Several interface windows have been created for user interaction. If the link that the user wants to follow
            is
            determined to be dangerous, the page loading stops, and a dialog box appears in which confirmation from the
            user about
            his intention to follow the link is required. The output message contains the URL of a site similar in
            spelling that the
            user visited earlier.
        </p>
        <img src="./screens/confirm_by_comp.png" style="width: 40%;height: auto;">
        <p>
            If the user does not agree with the recommended blocking of access to the site, click
            confirmations.
            After that, the site opens, and the domain name is added to the whitelist. The presence of a name in the
            whitelist
            says
            that the link is safe for the user, and it is no longer checked. Pressing the cancel button
            will result in
            closing the site and adding the domain name to the blacklist. The presence of it in the blacklist
            confirms
            the danger of the link. In case of an attempt to access a site that is present in the blacklist, the second
            one appears
            warning window:
        </p>
        <img src="./screens/confirm_from_blacklist.png" style="width: 40%;height: auto;">
        <p>
            In this case, similarly to the previous one, pressing the confirmation button will lead to ignoring
            warnings, the site will open, the link's domain name will be removed from the blacklist and added to the
            white list
            list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next window of the interface of the program's interaction with the user appears when you click on the
            icon of the
            Anti&nbspClone&nbspDefender program in the browser menu located to the right of the address bar:
        </p>
        <img src="./screens/in_top_bar.png" style="width: 40%;height: auto;">
        <p>This is a quick access window:
        </p>
        <img src="./screens/fast_access.png" style="width: 100%;height: auto;">
        <p>
            The "OFF/ON" button allows you to turn the extension on or off. The "Manage black and white lists" button
            opens the
            window for managing white and black lists of domain names. The "User manuals" button allows you to open the
            operating
            instructions. The white and black list management window looks like this:
        </p>
        <img src="./screens/black_and_white_lists.png" style="width: 60%;height: auto;">
        <p>
            Using this window, the user can, firstly, observe the automatically created lists of acceptable and
            unacceptable links
            to sites, and secondly, manually edit these lists in case there is additional information about existing
            malicious sites
            or about sites that do not need to be checked.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a domain name to any of the lists, enter it in the input field of the corresponding list and press
            the "Enter"
            key or the "+" button. To delete a domain name, you need to click the corresponding "×" button to the right
            of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usage examples:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Let's say your usual website for generating orders is park15logistics.com . In the mail correspondence,
                you receive a
                favorable offer, the term of which expires in the near future and it is proposed to issue it
                immediately. There is also
                a link to the website a15logistics.nl . With a quick glance, you can clearly see the name of the
                familiar company
                "15Logistics" (this site really existed and is in the archive of deleted phishing sites). But when you
                try to visit the
                site, the page loading stops and a warning dialog box appears. After reading the message, you understand
                that you
                usually used another website to contact this company. You just need to click the cancel button and the
                malicious site
                will not load and will be blacklisted.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are a site visitor hse.ru , when going to the site hce.ru you get a warning. When you click on the
                confirmation
                button, the site opens and is placed in the whitelist. Subsequently, its verification will not be
                carried out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your employee got on a phishing site. You go to the list management window and blacklist a link to this
                malicious site.
                Accidental access to this site is excluded for you.
            </li>
        </ul>
